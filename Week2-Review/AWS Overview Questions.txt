AWS
Cloud / AWS Overview
How would you describe AWS? What is "the cloud" or "cloud computing" and why is it so popular now?
	-Amazon Web Services
		-offer cloud solutions, as in outside premise, for whatever needs a company may need.
		-provides access to servers, storage, databases and application services over the internet
Define Infrastructure, Platform, and Software as a Service
	-Infrastructure aaS
		- Services where users only need to provide and manage application, data, runtime env. middleware and OS
	-Platform aaS
		- users only need to provide application and data
	-Software as a Service
		- everything is abstracted

What's the difference between a Region and an Availability Zone (AZ)?
	-Regions are groupings of AWS zones avilable worldwide
	-Availability zones are data centers containing infrastructure

How are you charged for using AWS services? Does it vary by service?
	-You are charged on a per-use-basis and it varies by service and requirements

Different ways to interact with AWS services?
	-Using one of the following
		-AWS Management Console - simple webo-based user interface
		-A command line interface - installed to acecess Amazon RDS API interactively
		-programmitcally, using an API

EC2
What are the configuration options for EC2?
	-AWS Elastic Compute Cloud
		-Allows users to rent virtual computers on wihich to run their own computer applications	
	-Config options:
		-Engine options
		-versions
		-templates
		-DB instance identifiers

What are the different EC2 instance sizes/types?
	Many different instance types that serve:
		-General purpose
		-Compute Optimized
		-Memory Optimized
		-Accelaerated Computing
		-Storage Optimized


Once you create an EC2, how to connect to it?
1) On AWS Management console, go to EC2 > Instances > click on instance that was just configured. CLick connect > SSH Client
2) Open command prompt(gitbash)
3) Run the provided command given as example.
4) Run Yes > should connect to EC2 instance.	

What are Security Groups? When defining a rule for a security group, what 3 things do you need to specify?
	- A security group acts as a firewall for your EC2 instances to control incoming and outgoing traffic based on their IP address.
	-When defining a rule for a security group, you need to specify:
		-Protocol
		-Port Range
		-ICMP Type
		-Source or destination

What's the difference between scalability, elasticity, and resiliency?
	-Elasticity
		- The ability to increase/decrease capacity in relation to instances.
	-Scalability
		- Ability to maintain application availability as required for larger capacity of instances.
	-Resiliency
		- The ablity for a cloud service to continue operations without going down (In the case of AWS over 99% reliablity).

Ways of paying for EC2?
	-On-demand
	-Savings Plans
	-Reserved Instances
	-Spot instances
	-Can pay for a dedicated host

RDS
What's an RDS?
	-A relational Database Service is a service that makes it easier to set up, operate, and scale a relational database in the (AWS) cloud.

Which vendors are supported?
-Amazon Aurora
-MySQL
